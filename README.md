.conky
======

My conky files for a simple bar across the bottom of my screen and a separate rss feed window. The rss feed will only load if ping can access google (a simple check for internet connectivity). Designed for 1920x1080 resolution.

Start `conky` by running `loadconky.sh`.

Some of this code was taken from [tr37ion/arch_news_conky](https://github.com/tr37ion/arch_news_conky) and modified.
